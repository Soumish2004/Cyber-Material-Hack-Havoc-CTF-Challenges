Dear Trithe,

As I write this, my heart brims with emotions that words struggle to express. I feel compelled to share my feelings with you, hoping they reach you as deeply as they reside in me.

From the moment we met, I sensed that our bond was unique, as if the universe itself had brought us together. Each day, my admiration for you grows. Your kindness, your intellect, and your laughter are just a few of the many things that captivate me.

I treasure every memory we've made together, from our first meeting to our countless conversations. I’ll never forget the bliss of hearing you whisper those special words: “LPXH_Z_AZRDSQZWJI” They echo in my heart, reminding me of the precious gift you are.

You are my confidante, my rock, my soulmate. I love you for your strength, your vulnerability, and the way you make me a better person.

With all my heart, I promise to cherish and love you always.

Yours forever,

Siegfried
