### Approach
After going to the given website, if we go through the source code, we see that there is a link to [homepage.html#](http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/homepage.html#), if we visit to that link, the page looks similar but its not. Now if we see the source code of this page we can see there is a link to some other page [dissssissssimpul/0.html](http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/0.html). Now when we inspect this page we find the flag in its source code.
