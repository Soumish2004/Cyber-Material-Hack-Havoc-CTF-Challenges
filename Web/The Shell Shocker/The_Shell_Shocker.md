## The Shell Shocker

### Points: 80
Our CyberMaterial developer thought they‚Äôd created the ultimate basic Linux shell, only the essentials, nothing fancy. But we think they might have missed a trick or two. üòè

Your task? See if you can get this shell to do something it wasn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to do. Think of it like asking a fish to climb a tree. üå≥üêü

### Approach
Opening the given website, we find that it is not able to load `style.css` and `script.js` as it is not getting url decoded,

so we open burp suite and send such requests manually using proxy

As we can see this url is not the right one ![alt text](image-3.png)
So we change this to the following

And we do that for `style.css` as well

Now we try doing `cat flag.txt` but it says invalid command, means we need to intercept the request again

So now we change the `command` to `cat flag.txt` when we intercept the request to execute `uname` ![alt text](image-7.png)
However it doesnt work

Now we are stuck, but seeing the error properly, we can understand that we are not in proper directory
![alt text](image-9.png)
we should put a request to `/a/exec` and not `/exec`
Doing this we get the flag
